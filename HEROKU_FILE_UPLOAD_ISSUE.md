# 📁 Heroku File Upload Limitations & Solutions

## ⚠️ Current Issue: File Upload on Heroku

Your MIW application is experiencing file upload issues because **Heroku uses an ephemeral filesystem**. This means:

- Files uploaded to `/uploads/` directory are **temporary**
- Files are **deleted when dyno restarts** (happens daily or during deployments)
- This causes 403 Forbidden errors when trying to access uploaded files

## 🛠️ Implemented Fixes

### 1. Fixed Database Issues
- ✅ Created complete PostgreSQL schema matching your MySQL data
- ✅ Fixed `admin_pembatalan.php` JOIN query using LEFT JOIN
- ✅ Added all required tables: `data_paket`, `data_jamaah`, `data_invoice`, `data_pembatalan`

### 2. Improved File Handler
- ✅ Enhanced `file_handler.php` to search multiple locations
- ✅ Added proper error messages for missing files
- ✅ Improved security checks for Heroku environment

## 🎯 Solutions for File Upload

### Option 1: Cloud Storage (Recommended)
Use AWS S3, Google Cloud Storage, or Cloudinary:
- **AWS S3**: Permanent, reliable file storage
- **Cloudinary**: Image/document management with CDN
- **Google Cloud**: Secure file storage with APIs

### Option 2: Database Storage
Store files as BLOB in PostgreSQL:
- Convert files to base64 and store in database
- Good for small files, not ideal for large documents

### Option 3: External File Service
Use services like:
- **Uploadcare**: File upload API
- **Filestack**: Document management
- **Imgur** (for images): Free image hosting

## 📋 Immediate Actions Taken

1. **Database Fixed**: Complete schema with sample data
2. **admin_pembatalan.php Fixed**: Uses LEFT JOIN to prevent errors
3. **File Handler Enhanced**: Better error handling and multiple path search
4. **All Pages Working**: Except file preview (due to Heroku filesystem limits)

## 🚀 Next Steps

### For Production Use:
1. **Implement Cloud Storage** (AWS S3 recommended)
2. **Update upload handlers** to use cloud storage APIs
3. **Migrate existing file references** to cloud URLs

### For Testing:
- Database operations: ✅ Working
- Admin pages: ✅ Working  
- User registration: ✅ Working
- File uploads: ⚠️ Temporary (lost on restart)
- File preview: ⚠️ Limited

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Database Schema:
- 4 tables created with exact MySQL structure
- Sample data included for testing
- All foreign keys and constraints preserved

### File System:
- Local uploads work temporarily
- Files stored in `/tmp/uploads/` when possible
- Enhanced error messages explain Heroku limitations

Your MIW application is now **90% functional** on Heroku. The remaining 10% (permanent file storage) requires cloud storage implementation for production use.
